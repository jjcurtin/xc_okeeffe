Hi everyone

Great to see so many of you out there yesterday supporting our kids.  And a big thanks to the many of you that volunteered to make the meet succeed.   From my perspective, it seemed a big success for a first time event!

Many of you were asking about other options for your kids to race track or XC style events appropriate for middle school runners.  At this point, MSCR does not currently support track for the MMSD middle schools.  I've been working with them to change their mind on this and they have just hired a new running liason/coordinator for the middle school so I hope to use this meet to make clear to them the level of interest in a spring track season.  Stay tuned for progress in future years.

We put the meet last  night in place because I really wanted all our kids to get a chance to race as part of our school team to keep them excited and set goals.  As many of you know,
