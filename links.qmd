O'Keeffe runners and parents,

It is very important that we are able to communicate with both kids and parents on the Fall Cross Country Team and the Spring Running Club. 


Kids should join the club's google classroom and check the classroom regularly.  If we need to cancel a practice or event, we will announce it there.  Code to join is **vkczlcw**

Parents should join the associated What's App group chat.  We will post cancellations and other parent focused information there.  Parent's can join this chat through this link: **https://chat.whatsapp.com/IR4QfOK6wj65lKHe31NeNa**


We plan to use both of these platforms to communicate about opportunities to run together over the summer as well.

Thanks!

The O'Keeffe Coaches

John, Chandra, and Jonny
